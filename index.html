        <p>Woah! You have uncovered my website!</p>
        <p>Well, as of the moment, there is a severe lack of content on this page as you can see. I guess this is going to have to do as an "under construction" page for now? Or maybe I leave it. Time will tell, won't it?</p>
        <p>However you can watch the bubblesort in the bottom, regardless of this page's completion. That's just going to be a thing because I think it looks cool.</p>
        <p>Oh yeah, you can click on the tabs above to view projects that I've bothered to list here, or the contact button if you want to... well... contact.. me... I mean, that is what the button says, I would hope that it is not to complicated for you to figure out. If it is, go to a doctor and get help. Actually finish exploring my site first, then doctor.</p>
