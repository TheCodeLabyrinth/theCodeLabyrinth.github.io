        <p>Below are projects I have put together during the school year this far (Started Sept 3, 2019), as well as date created (made in single day), and any other useful information.</p>
        <p>I also uploaded incomplete projects, things that I never either fixed once I broke them or bothered to complete at all. If you want to enable them, press the clicky button. However, I warn you, they are useless and broken so don't get your hopes up.</p>
