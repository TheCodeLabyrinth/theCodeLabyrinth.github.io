        <p>Hello! You have found my contact page! I am going to assume you are here to, you know, contact me in one way or another, otherwise you should probably be at <a href='/'>Home</a> or <a href='projects'>Projects</a>.</p>
        <p>Well of course, probably the fastest way to get me to reply, is using my Twitter, <a href='https://www.twitter.com/LabyrinthOfCode'>@LabyrinthOfCode</a>. My DMs are open, so go right ahead and send me a message.</p>
        <p>Of course, not everyone has Twitter, so I am also available via email, <a href='mailto:theCodeLabyrinth@googlemail.com'>theCodeLabyrinth@googlemail.com</a>, and I will probably get that too, though I gaurentee nothing. Reply will be within a day or two tops.</p>
        <p>If you can not do either, than you are probably out of luck. Sorry about that, but if I may ask - How do you not have an email in 2019? Scratch that, I can't ask... you can't give me an answer...</p>
        <p>I will answer any questions I am able, be it about tech repair (oh god), programming (thank god), or something else (I'm scared already in that case), just don't expect the most easy to comprehend answer. I go more for accuracy than simplicity most of the time.</p>
